                    I had so many things that i thought that i loved, but the truth was i couldnt even appreciate any of
                    it because there was too much. <br>
                    <br>
                    Things were terrible. I had a job that i hated, a home that i didnt want to live in, and i couldnt
                    hold a relationship. <br>

                        <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when i got rid of everything</strong>. I literally put
                        90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and i
                        quit my job. <br>
                        <br>
                        It wasnt easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place. I didnt know what else
                        to do. And it worked. <br>

                        Now that im living a simple life, things are so much better. Im less stressed, enjoy life and
                        work more, and i have more free time to enjoy. <br>
                        <br>
                        With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like i had no choice but to start sharing
                            how i did it</strong> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is
                        why i started this site!
